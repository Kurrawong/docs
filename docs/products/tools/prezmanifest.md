# prezmanifest

_A Prez Manifest is an RDF file that describes and links to a set of resources that can be loaded into an RDF database 
for [Prez](../prez) to provide access to._

To support the use of Prez Manifests, we supply a Python library and command line tool called _prezmanifest_ that 
provides a series of functions to work with them. The functions provided are:

* documentation
* validation
* loading - into aggregated data files or databases
* labeller

prezmanifest has detailed documentation for installation and use at its repository's home page:
