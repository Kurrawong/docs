# RDF format converter


This conversion tool relies on the Python RDF manipulation library, [RDFLib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/). This allows it to handle more RDF formats than other packages. 

If you have RDF files that you would like to convert to another RDF format, we provide an online GUI with some of our other useful tools [here](https://tools.dev.kurrawong.ai/). 

To find out more about other ways KurrawongAI could provide Knowledge Graph tools that solve *your* data problems, visit the KurrawongAI [tools](https://kurrawong.ai/services/tools) page for more information on our specialised Knowledge Graph Tooling Support.
