# kurra Python Library

kurra is a Python library and command line application that provides commonly-required functionality when working with 
RDF files and databases.

This library uses the [RDFLib](https://pypi.org/project/rdflib/) under-the-hood to process 
[RDF](https://www.w3.org/RDF/) data. It supplies functions to:

* manipulate local RDF files
* send commands to RDF databases - "triplestores"
* SPARQL query files or databases

kurra has detailed documentation for installation and use at its repository's home page:

!!! note

    kurra is a dependency of other KurrawongAI tooling, such as [labelify](labelify.md) & 
	[prez-manifest](../prez/manifest.md).
