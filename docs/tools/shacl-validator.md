# RDF data SHACL validator


Our RDF [SHACL](https://www.w3.org/TR/shacl/) validation tools allows users to validate RDF against either their own specific SHACL validation rules, or select from a pre-loaded set of validators selected from commonly used profiles.

If you have RDF that you would like to validate using SHACL inputs, we provide an online GUI with some of our other useful tools [here](https://tools.dev.kurrawong.ai/). To find out more about other ways KurrawongAI could provide Knowledge Graph tools that solve *your* data problems, visit the KurrawongAI [tools](https://kurrawong.ai/services/tools) page for more information on our specialised Knowledge Graph Tooling Support.
