## SHACL Validator
You can check that your vocabulary is valid by using a SHACL validator. What does _valid_ mean, and what is SHACL? 

A vocabulary validator will typically check for two things:

- the RDF syntax is valid - e.g. there are correct end of line terminators; all prefixes are defined;
- the vocabulary conforms to some vocabulary profile - a set of rules or quality measures that state what classes and properties feature in the vocabulary, and that certain datatypes are used to express property values.

SHACL (W3C, 2017), or the _Shapes Constraint Language_, is a way of encoding a vocabulary profile so that it is machine-readable and used in some tool to check a vocabulary's conformance with that profile. 

A SHACL file can be used in various validation tools and services - here we'll demonstrate the KurrawongAI SHACL Validator, with a special focus on the VocPub profile.
